      Type of normalization. (default: base)
      If no normalization is needed, set '--scale no' argument, the program will disregard this option.
      Options:
        1) reads: No. of mapped reads/fragments
        2) base: Sum of per-base coverage of reads/fragments

    type: string?

    doc: |
      Method to scale samples together. (default: genome)
      Options are:
        1) no: no scaling, just calculate coverage
        2) smallest: scale reads to smallest library (multiple-samples only)
        3) genome: scale samples to 1x genome coverage (only possible with 'base' normalization type)

    doc: |
      Operation to perform when scaling samples. Default: scaled
      Options are:
        1) scaled: output scaled tracks.
        2) unscaled: do not scale files in any way.
        2) log2: log2 transform against first BAM file.
        3) ratio: coverage ratio against first BAM file.
        4) subtract: subtract coverage against first BAM file.
        5) rfd: OK-seq RFD calculation

      Compute sequencing coverage from BAM file. (default: '1', count reads while parsing BAM)
      Options are:
        1) 0: use reads in index (only if normalization is set to 'reads')
        2) 1: count reads while parsing BAM(s)
      WARNING: this option is only useful when 'reads' are used for normalization

      BED file with regions to subtract when computing coverage for normalization
      These coordinates should not overlap so reads are not counted multiple times

    doc: |
      Smoothen signal by calculating mean of N bins flanking both sides of each bin (default: 0)
      If set to '0', the signal is not smoothened. To turn on specify a value greater than '0'.
      For replication timing, a good value is to smoothen to 100k bases. If binSize is 100bp, this would be '1000'

    type: int?
    inputBinding:
      position: 3

    doc: |
      Which tracks should be smoothened when performing smoothening (default: '1' meaning only binned track).
      Options are:
        1) 0: Smoothen scaled and transformed tracks (log2, ratio or subtracted)
        2) 1: Smoothen only the scaled sequencing track
        3) 2: Smoothen only the transformed (log2, ratio or subtract) track
